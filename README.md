# NeonSign
    Description:

        - A neon sign saying "coding" using only divs and flexbox to test the power of these features.
        Responsive design with a centered background; elements using units like vw, vh and percentage; and calc. 
        
    Knowledges applied:

        .divs to design the letters
        .flexbox to orient the elements, grid probably would be better, but I wanted to explore the power of flex divs
        .powerful colors to give it a neon kinda style
        .shadows to give it a neon kinda style
        .two containers to apply shadows in and out of them to give it a neon kinda style
        .gradient background inside the letters to give it a neon kinda style
        .round borders to make it look more aesthetic
        .responsive units to adjust the sign to whatever device's width and height it is dealing with, resize the window however you want, check it!
        .variables used to quickly select any color theme you want, just change them however you like, go on!
        .viewport meta tag to adjust the width according to the device's width
        .description meta tag to help browsers understand the content
        .link tag to add icon to the browser tab bar
        .and more
